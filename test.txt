Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other beachgoers have stopped their activities. The boy considers defying his father. He puts his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at the other side. One good stretch would do it. FATHER (reading Truman's mind, enraged) No! TRUMAN (sensing his father is keeping something from him) Why? What's there? FATHER (unconvincing) Nothing's there. It's the same as this. (trace of desperation) Come down, please. Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other beachgoers have stopped their activities to stare at him. Reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks. When he finally jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and drags him away down the beach. FATHER I told you to stay close. Don't ever leave my sight again. You gotta know your limitations. You could've been washed away by the tide. EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT. MORNING. TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks briskly down the bustling street. A snarl of taxis, buses and COMMUTER traffic. A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye.
